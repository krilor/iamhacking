Wordlists, in a hacking/pentest/ctf setting, usually means a password list that can be fed into hashcrackers such as hashcat and john the ripper.

Today I will find and list all the wordlists I can find online. As part of that exercise I will also try to figure out what types of wordlists are out there and what are the best/most commonly used ones.

Let's have at it.

## Strategy

1. I will start by looking at awesome-lists
2. Pinned redit posts to see if I can find some curated list allready made.
3. Visit hashcat and john documentation/wiki/forums to see what I can find there.
4. Good'ol google-fu

## Awesome-lists

Both [awesome-pentest](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest) and [awesome-ctf](https://github.com/apsdehal/awesome-ctf) had some pretty good resources, but no wordlists.

## Reddit

The [r/hacking wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/hacking/wiki/index) have a really nice curated list of wordlists.



-   [Probable Wordlists - Version 2.0](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists) - Version 2 is live! Wordlists sorted by probability originally created for password generation and testing - make sure your passwords aren't popular!
-   [Real Passwords](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists/blob/master/Real-Passwords) - These are REAL passwords.
-   [Dictionary-Style Lists](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists/blob/master/Dictionary-Style) - Files including dictionaries, encyclopedic lists and miscellaneous. Wordlists in this folder were not necessarily associated with the "password" label.
